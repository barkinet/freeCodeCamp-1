# Use the Twitchtv JSON API

1. Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: [https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/Myvqmo/](https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/Myvqmo/).

2. Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

3. **User Story**: I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.

4. **User Story**: I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.

5. **User Story**: if a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.

6. **User Story**: I will see a placeholder notification if a streamer has closed their Twitch account (or the account never existed). You can verify this works by adding brunofin and comster404 to your array of Twitch streamers.

7. **Hint**: See an example call to Twitch.tv's JSONP API at [http://forum.freecodecamp.com/t/use-the-twitchtv-json-api/19541](http://forum.freecodecamp.com/t/use-the-twitchtv-json-api/19541).

8. **Hint**: The relevant documentation about this API call is here: [https://github.com/justintv/Twitch-API/blob/master/v3_resources/streams.md#get-streamschannel](https://github.com/justintv/Twitch-API/blob/master/v3_resources/streams.md#get-streamschannel).

9. **Hint**: Here's an array of the Twitch.tv usernames of people who regularly stream: ["ESL_SC2", "OgamingSC2", "cretetion", "freecodecamp", "storbeck", "habathcx", "RobotCaleb", "noobs2ninjas"]

10. **UPDATE**: Due to a change in conditions on API usage explained here Twitch.tv now requires an API key, but we've built a workaround. Use [https://wind-bow.gomix.me/twitch-api](https://wind-bow.gomix.me/twitch-api) instead of twitch's API base URL (i.e. https://api.twitch.tv/kraken ) and you'll still be able to get account information, without needing to sign up for an API key.

11. Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck.

12. When you are finished, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and include a link to your CodePen.

13. You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.
